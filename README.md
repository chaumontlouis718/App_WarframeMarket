# App_WarframeMarket
Simple App to visualize Warframe price from WarframeMarket
You get the minimum price for every warframe piece of each warframe in the table.
We only take the price where users who create the offers is marked as "InGame" for WarframeMarket.
So you see the price of the full set comparated with the addition of each piece taken separately
See simple demo :
